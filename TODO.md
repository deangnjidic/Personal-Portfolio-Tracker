- Keep localStorage as primary storage (no backend required)
- Analytics tracks page views ONLY - portfolio data stays 100% local
- Ensure offline functionality after initial load
- API keys (config.js) should never be committed to git
- GA tracking ID is PUBLIC and safe to commit (see SECRETS-GUIDE.md)
- CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license prohibits commercial use/resale
